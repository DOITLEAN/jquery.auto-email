# Auto-Email
### An autocomplete JQuery plugin for email fields

![auto-email](https://github.com/chrisyuska/auto-email/raw/master/screenshot.png)

This plugin autocompletes email addresses when supplied with an email domain.  Instead of the regular JQuery autocomplete's dropdown menu of autocomplete suggestions, this types ahead while keeping the auto-filled text highlighted as to not obstruct the user.

### Demo

## To use this plugin, download the file and on pageload, call:

```javascript
$('#your-field').autoEmail("yourdomain.com");
```

##### This is in early development, so it's not perfect.
