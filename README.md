# Auto-Email
### An autocomplete JQuery plugin for email fields

This plugin autocompletes email addresses when supplied with an email domain.  Instead of the regular JQuery autocomplete's dropdown menu of autocomplete suggestions, this types ahead while keeping the auto-filled text highlighted as to not obstruct the user.

## To use this plugin, download the file and on pageload call:

```javascript
$('#your-field').autoEmail("yourdomain.com");
```

##### This is in early development, so it's not perfect.
